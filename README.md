# COOLution
We created this program with the intention of further investigating the mass and cooling age of the white dwarf. We also wanted to have control over the priors used in the MCMC process along with performing a dynamical and joint photometric analysis. Given a photometric data point that coincides with an instrument listed in the cooling models and a parallax, the program fits the free parameters. These include the mass, age, and parallax of the white dwarf. 

By creating classes for different priors, each free parameter can be customized to be a Gaussian, Log Uniform or Uniform prior. The samples are drawn to set the initial walker positions. For each step in the MCMC chain, the mass, and age are used to interpolate between the models. The interpolated photometry values for each filter are converted into apparent magnitudes and compared to the measured data. 

Our primary objective for creating this package was to merge the dynamical results from `orbitize!` in a self-consistent manner. By incorporating the necessary posteriors for mass and parallax as priors in our package, we could continue the MCMC analysis with the addition of more parameters. This strategy was adopted instead of adding additional parameters to `orbitize!` directly to promote efficiency and reduce the total time to perform an analysis. Currently, the package produces broad posteriors when given a small number of photometric data. This is mostly in the mass and age posteriors.
